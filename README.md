How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that functionality and security is implemented, I will write unit tests that can validate each component
of my write code and use test-driven development pratices. I will also implement any secure coding standards
and validate user input to prevent visible vulnerabilities. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I will anlayze the project requirements and other feedback  to understand user expectations. I will then implement those needs
into functional specifications and design features that align with those specific expectations.

How do I approach designing software?
Like most projects, you would want to break down the expectations into smaller components or " to do's" and identify the core
functionality. Object- oriented principles to structure my code and ensure its modular, resusable, and easy to run.
